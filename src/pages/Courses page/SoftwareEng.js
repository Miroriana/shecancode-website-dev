          <h4>Backend Development</h4>
          <p>
          Backend development is the behind-the-scenes magic that powers websites, making them functional and dynamic. In this process, we leverage a powerful trio of technologies: JavaScript for scripting, Express JS for building robust web applications, and Node JS for executing server-side code efficiently. MongoDB, a flexible and scalable database, helps store and manage data seamlessly.<span className='hide'>Together, these tools enable us to create interactive and responsive web applications, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.</span>
